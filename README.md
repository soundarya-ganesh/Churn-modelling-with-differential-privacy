# Churn-modelling-with-differential-privacy-Neural-Nets
 
 This Folder contains codes, datasets and reports for a project on a comparitive study on Differential Privacy with Neural Networks
 
 The Project included the following steps: 
 
1. Dataset Selection
2. EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)
3. Feature Selection (Information + Privacy)
4. Pre-Processing

  * 4.1 Check for Missing and Anomalous data
  
  * 4.2 Encoding Categorical Columns
  
  * 4.3 Standard Scaling
  
5. Train-Validation-Test Split
6. Two Approaches for Training
 I. Training an ANN
    Without Age Modification
    With Age Modification
    Dropping Age Feature
		II. Training a Differentially Private ANN
7. Results & Performance Metrics
8. Interpretation of Efficiency & Learning Outcomes

 
The File: EAD_NormalANN contains Notebook for training a normal ANN with the Churn Modelling Dataset

The File: EAD_Diff_Privacy_ANN contains Notebook for training a Differentially Private ANN with the Churn Modelling Dataset

For Detailed Results and Explainations, please read the Report Team17_ChurnModelling_DiffPriv_ANN
